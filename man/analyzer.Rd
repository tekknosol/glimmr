\usage{
analyzer(time_stamp = "timestamp", conc_columns = NULL, preassure = NULL,
  preassure_factor = 1, temperature = NULL, manual_temperature = NULL,
  offset = "offset", duration_count = FALSE, spot = "spot", day = "day",
  start = "start", end = "end", trimmer = NULL, V = 0.01461,
  A = 0.098)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_stamp}{Timestamp}

\item{conc_columns}{A named vector declaring the columns containing the
actual mixing rations. E.g. `c(CO2  = "CO2")`.}

\item{preassure}{Column containing the atmospheric preasure in mbar.}

\item{preassure_factor}{If preasure is provided in a different unit than
mbar, a conversion factor can be specified.}

\item{temperature}{Column containing the temperature in Â°C.}

\item{manual_temperature}{Column conatining an additional measured temperature.
If specified, the `temperature` value is ommited.}

\item{offset}{(Default = `0:0`). Colon separated value for offsetting the
datasets. First value offsets the first, second value offsets the last
datapoint. Positive values shrinken the dataset i.e `2:3` skips two
datapoints at the beginning and truncates three datapoints at the end of
the dataset. Negative values expand the dataset i.e. `-2:-3` add two
datapoints at the beginning and three datapoints at the end of the dataset.}

\item{duration_count}{If TRUE, `end` is determined by the number of datapoints
within each measurement. If FALSE, `end` is treated as duration or point in time.}

\item{spot}{(Default = "spot"). Column containing the ID of the measurement location.}

\item{day}{(Default = "day"). Column containing the day of measurement. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{start}{(Default = "start"). Column containing the start of measurement. Format: "HH:MM" or "HH:MM:SS".}

\item{end}{(Default = "end"). Column containing the end of measurement. There are several options:

  Point in Time. Format: "HH:MM" or "HH:MM:SS" (e.g. `"13:43"`).

  Duration in minutes (e.g. `5`).

  Number of Datapoints regardless of the effectively elapsed time (e.g. `10`).
  This behaviour is controlled by `duration_count`.

  Alternatively a single number treated as Duration or Number of Datapoints for all measurements (e.g. `5`, behaviour is again controlled by `duration_count`).}

\item{trimmer}{A function to trim the intervall between `start` and `end`. See `trim_time()` for details.}

\item{V}{Volume of the chamber.}

\item{A}{Area of the chamber.}
