This vignette summarises the options for setting up options specified with gals().

## Gas analyzer
  
  * **time_stamp** Column containing a timestamp.
  
  * **conc_columns** A named vector declaring the columns containing the actal mixing rations. E.g. `c(CO2  = "CO2")`.
  
  * **preassure** Column containing the atmospheric preasure in mbar. 
  
  * **preassure_factor** If preasure is provided in a different unit than mbar, a conversion factor can be specified. 
  
  * **temperature** Column containing the temperature in Â°C

## Meta data

  * **manual_temperature** Column conatining an additional measured temperature.
    If specified, the `temperature` value is ommited. 
  
  * **offset** (Default = `0:0`). Colon separated value for offsetting the datasets. First value offsets the first, second value offsets the last datapoint. Positive values shrinken the dataset i.e `2:3` skips two datapoints at the beginning and truncates three datapoints at the end of the dataset. Negative values expand the dataset i.e. `-2:-3` add two datapoints at the beginning and three datapoints at the end of the dataset. 
  
Alternatively name of column containing the value for each measurement individually (e.g. `offset`). 
  
  * **duration_count** If TRUE, `end` is determined by the number of datapoints 
    within each measurement. If FALSE, `end` is treated as duration or point in time.  
  
  * **spot** (Default = "spot"). Column containing the ID of the measurement location. 
  
  * **day** (Default = "day"). Column containing the day of measurement. Format: "YYYY-MM-DD".
  
  * **start** (Default = "start"). Column containing the start of measurement. Format: "HH:MM" or "HH:MM:SS"
  
  * **end** (Default = "end"). Column containing the end of measurement. There are several options:
  
    Point in Time. Format: "HH:MM" or "HH:MM:SS" (e.g. `"13:43"`). 
    
    Duration in minutes (e.g. `5`).
    
    Number of Datapoints regardless of the effectively elapsed time (e.g. `10`).
    This behaviour is controlled by `duration_count`.
    
    Alternatively a single number treated as Duration or Number of Datapoints for all measurements (e.g. `5`, behaviour is again controlled by `duration_count`).
  
  * **trimmer** A function to trim the intervall between `start` and `end`. See `trim_time()` for details.

## Chamber
 * **V** Volume of the chamber.
 * **A** Area of the chamber.
